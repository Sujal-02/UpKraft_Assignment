# 🔧 GitHub Pages 404 Fix Guide

## Current Issue

✅ **Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow is running successfully
❌ **Website**: Showing 404 error at https://sujal-02.github.io/UpKraft_Assignment/

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Most Important)

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Sujal-02/UpKraft_Assignment
2. Click **Settings** (tab at the top)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (in left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Repository is Public

- If your repo is private, GitHub Pages won't work on free accounts
- Go to Settings → General → Change repository visibility to **Public**

### Step 3: Force Re-deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on the latest "Deploy React App to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click **Re-run all jobs** (if it failed)
4. OR make a small commit to trigger new deployment

### Step 4: Check Deployment Status

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Wait for green checkmark ✅ on latest workflow
3. Check **deploy** job completed successfully

## 🔍 Alternative Debugging Steps

### If Still 404 After Above Steps:

**Option A: Check Repository Name**
Current config uses: `/UpKraft_Assignment/`
If your repo name is different, update `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
base: mode === "production" ? "/YOUR_ACTUAL_REPO_NAME/" : "/",
```

**Option B: Try Different URL Paths**

- https://sujal-02.github.io/UpKraft_Assignment/
- https://sujal-02.github.io/UpKraft_Assignment/index.html

**Option C: Check Build Output**
Repository should have these files after successful deployment:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` ✅
- `dist/spa/index.html` (generated by build)
- `dist/spa/assets/` (generated by build)

## 🎯 Expected Result

After fixing, you should see the UPKRAFT dashboard at:

## 📞 If Still Not Working

Try alternative deployment platforms:

- [Connect to Netlify](#open-mcp-popover) - Often more reliable
- [Connect to Vercel](#open-mcp-popover) - Excellent for React apps

The issue is most likely **Step 1** - GitHub Pages source not set to "GitHub Actions".
