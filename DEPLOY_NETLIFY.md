# ðŸš€ Deploy UPKRAFT Dashboard to Netlify

## Why Netlify Instead of GitHub Pages?

âœ… **Much Simpler Setup** - No complex configuration needed
âœ… **Better SPA Support** - Perfect for React Router applications  
âœ… **Instant Deployments** - Deploy in under 2 minutes
âœ… **Automatic HTTPS** - SSL certificates included
âœ… **Custom Domains** - Easy to add your own domain later

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Deploy (2 Steps)

### Option A: Drag & Drop Deploy (Fastest)
1. **Zip the build folder**: 
   - Go to `dist/spa/` folder in your project
   - Select all files inside and create a zip
2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
   - Drag your zip file
   - Your site will be live in 30 seconds!

### Option B: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)
1. **[Connect to Netlify](#open-mcp-popover)** using the MCP integration
2. **Or manually**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) 
   - Click "Import from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select `UpKraft_Assignment` repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`

## âœ… Configuration Applied

Your project is now pre-configured for Netlify with:

- **Build Command**: `pnpm build:client`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist/spa`
- **SPA Routing**: All routes redirect to `index.html`
- **Performance Headers**: Caching and security headers
- **Base Path**: Removed (not needed for Netlify)

## ðŸ”§ Files Updated for Netlify

1. **`netlify.toml`** - Netlify configuration
2. **`vite.config.ts`** - Removed GitHub Pages base path
3. **Build output** - Regenerated with correct paths

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Result

Once deployed, your UPKRAFT dashboard will be available at:
